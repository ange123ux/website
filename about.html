                <h3>My education</h3>
                <p>I am a students in Southern New Hampshire Universty under Kepler program. I am currently pursuing
                    Communications in Business and I am currently taking web development courses in Moringa School,under
                    WeCode
                    Program in Rwanda. I enjoy doing anything related to coding because I got the best experience in it.

                <ul>
                    <li>I worked in a company called TABOR Ltd as a Cashier for the period of 1 year.</li>
                    <li>I worked in Jomo Kenyatta University as a receiptionist for a period of six months.</li>
                    <li>I worked in Kepler Institute as a receiptionist for a period of six months.</li>

                <h3>Why programming?</h3>
                <p>I chose to take this path because in the future I want to develop websites and mobile applications
                    that
                    organizations will use to communicate with their clients. Also, I found that it will help me to
                    think out of
                    the box because the more I code, the higher chances I get of solving many problems that I encounter
                    with in my
                    daily life.</p>
