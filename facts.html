            <h3>More Details about programming languages</h3>
            <p> <strong>1. HTML</strong></p>
            Hyper Text Markup language is the foundation and the wooden framework of the house, which doesn't look
            pretty unless CSS comes in. Some sites such as Ford, Peugeot and Lacoste use HTML.
            <p> <strong>2. CSS</strong></p>
            Cascading Style Sheets is a collection of style tags used to make the website styled. It is taken as the
            paint to the house. Most websites make use of CSS.
            <p> <strong>3. Javascript</strong></p>
            The simplest example of what Javascript can do is: If this, then that. As simple as that. Lost World Fairs
            as well as Cascade Brewery websites use Javascript.

            <p> <strong> 5. Bootstrap</strong></p>
            Bootstrap contributes in building responsive, mobile-first websites, and it is easy to learn it. Newsweek
            and Lyft sites use Bootstrap.
